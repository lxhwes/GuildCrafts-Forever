## Future Candidates

Items in this section are not a committed release. They are candidates — each one only worth building if there is real user demand, a clear scope boundary, or a contributor ready to own it.

---

### [#7] Export to CSV / Text

> **What it is:** A `/gc export` command that dumps the full guild recipe database to a format that can be copied out of the game for spreadsheets or guild websites.

**Implementation notes:**
- WoW addons cannot write arbitrary files. The standard workaround is to write the export into a `SavedVariables` entry as a plain string, then instruct the user to open `WTF/Account/.../SavedVariables/GuildCrafts.lua` and copy the value. Alternatively — and more user-friendly — open a full-screen scrollable text frame the user can Ctrl+A / Ctrl+C from directly in-game.
- The in-game copy frame approach is strongly preferred (no file system navigation required). Use `AceGUIContainer-Frame` fullscreen with a `MultiLineEditBox` set to read-only.
- CSV columns: `Member, Profession, Recipe, SkillLevel, Specialisation, Category, LastScanned`.
- For large guilds (50+ members, 500+ recipes per member), build the CSV string incrementally using `table.concat` on a parts list to avoid string concatenation performance degradation.
- Consider coroutine-based generation if the dataset causes frame drops (unlikely for typical guild sizes, but guard it).

**Files:** `Core.lua` (new `/gc export` slash handler), `UI/MainFrame.lua` (export frame), `Data.lua` (new `ExportCSV()` method).

---

### [#9] Code Modularisation

> **What it is:** Split `Data.lua` (1,884 lines) and `UI/MainFrame.lua` (2,371 lines) into focused sub-modules.

> **Honest assessment:** This is an internal housekeeping task with zero user-visible impact. It is only worth doing if (a) you are actively onboarding a new contributor who needs navigable files, or (b) a specific file is causing repeated PR conflicts. Otherwise it is a productivity cost dressed up as progress. The current file sizes are large but not dysfunctional for a single maintainer. **Do not let this block or delay any user-facing work.**

**Implementation notes:**
- This is a pure refactor with zero user-visible changes. Do it in one PR to avoid a long-lived split-state.
- Suggested split for `Data.lua`:
  - `Data/Scan.lua` — `ScanTradeSkills`, `ScanCraft`, `ScanCurrentProfession`
  - `Data/Merge.lua` — `MergeIncoming`, `MergeDelta`, `MergeProfessionRemoval`
  - `Data/Search.lua` — `SearchRecipes`, `StripVowels`, `BuildSearchIndex`
  - `Data/Roster.lua` — `RebuildOnlineCache`, `PruneStaleMembers`, `GetPlayerKey`
  - `Data/DB.lua` — `OnInitialize`, `GetGuildDB`, `GetVersionVector`, `StripSyncFields`
- Suggested split for `UI/MainFrame.lua`:
  - `UI/RecipesView.lua` — profession sidebar, recipes list, post button
  - `UI/SearchView.lua` — search bar, results list
  - `UI/MemberView.lua` — member detail panel
  - `UI/MainFrame.lua` — frame creation, tab navigation, `Refresh()`
- All sub-modules share the same `GuildCrafts` global and use the same `local _, _ns = ...` bootstrap pattern.
- Update `embeds.xml` and `GuildCrafts.toc` to load new files in dependency order.

**Files:** Many — treat as a full refactor milestone.

## Backlog (no milestone assigned)

| Issue | Title | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| [#21](https://github.com/dkruenbo/GuildCrafts/issues/21) | Coalesce login sync storms on DR | Premature optimisation — no reported user pain. Revisit if DR lag is observed during raid-start login surges. |
| [#22](https://github.com/dkruenbo/GuildCrafts/issues/22) | Piggyback version vector hash on HEARTBEAT | Premature optimisation — SYNC_REQUESTs at login are legitimate, not redundant. Revisit if telemetry shows unnecessary round-trips. |
| [#19](https://github.com/dkruenbo/GuildCrafts/issues/19) | Incremental sync: send only changed professions | Premature optimisation. `DELTA_UPDATE` already handles the real-time case; the full-member SYNC_RESPONSE only fires for members who were offline, and LibDeflate already compresses those payloads well. The implementation touches version vector format, merge semantics, `StripSyncFields`, and requires capability negotiation in `HELLO` — meaningful surface area for a problem with no reported user pain. Revisit only if a 50+ member guild reports slow post-login sync or chat throttle hits. Benchmark first. |
| — | Old guild partition cleanup | Detect and offer to clean up `db.global` partitions from guilds the user is no longer in. Detection heuristic ("contains a hyphen") is weak — needs a more explicit partition identity model (e.g. a `_guildPartition = true` metadata flag written at partition creation time) before auto-detection is safe enough to act on. Non-destructive `/gc cleanup` command with confirmation is the right shape. Non-urgent — slow-moving problem, only affects guild-hoppers. |
| — | Quick-action buttons in search results (Request / Post) | Convenience shortcut. Low complexity, good candidate for a 1.2.x patch after 1.2.0 ships. |
| — | Cooldown panel: dedicated UI panel showing who has what on cooldown and when it expires | Basic cooldown tracking (Mooncloth, Shadowcloth, Spellcloth, Transmutes) is already implemented and visible in the existing UI. This item is a separate, focused panel — a dedicated view listing all guild cooldowns with expiry countdowns. Requires DR to broadcast cooldown state in real time; design needed before implementation. |
