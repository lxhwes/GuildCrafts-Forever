# GuildCrafts — Guild Profession Tracker for WoW Classic

**The fastest way to find a crafter in your guild.**

Stop asking in guild chat _"Can anyone craft this?"_ and waiting for replies.

GuildCrafts automatically builds a **shared profession database for your entire guild** — tracking every recipe, every crafter, every specialization across all WoW Classic versions.

Search any item and instantly see **who can craft it**, what reagents it needs, and whether the crafter is online.

You can even search directly from guild chat — no addon needed for the person asking:

`!gc shadowcloth`  
`!gc spellstrike hood`  
`!gc flask`

***

# Why Guilds Use GuildCrafts

### Find Crafters Without Asking in Chat

Type `!gc <item name>` in guild chat.  
GuildCrafts automatically replies with matching crafters.

**The person asking does NOT need the addon installed** — only crafters need it.

Perfect for raids, farming sessions, or when browsing the auction house.

### Automatic Recipe Sync Between Guild Members

GuildCrafts combines the recipes of all addon users into a **single searchable guild recipe book**.

*   Recipes sync automatically — no manual setup
*   New recipes broadcast instantly when learned
*   Works silently in the background with minimal chat traffic
*   The more guild members who install it, the more complete the database

### Item Tooltip Crafters

Hover any item anywhere in the game — bags, auction house, trade chat, mail — and see **which guild members can craft it** directly in the tooltip.

No chat, no alt-tabbing, no external websites.

***

# Guild Recipe Browser

GuildCrafts includes a full **profession recipe browser** for your guild.

### Members View — Browse Recipes by Crafter

See **every recipe known by a specific guild member**.

Useful when you already know who might craft something.

### Recipes View — Browse Crafters by Recipe

See **every guild member who can craft a recipe**.

*   Hover recipes to inspect the crafted item
*   Expand recipes to view reagent materials
*   Hover reagents to inspect them
*   Hover the crafter preview to see the full crafter list
*   Click `[W]` to whisper a crafter directly — chat opens pre-filled
*   Click `[>]` to post crafters directly to guild chat

### Expansion Filters — Vanilla · TBC · WotLK · Cata · MoP

Five toggle buttons let you filter recipes by expansion. Toggle any combination to show only the recipes you care about. Your selection persists across sessions.

### Online Filter & Tooltip Toggle

**\[Online\]** hides offline members across the member list, crafter lists, and profession counts. Glows gold when active.

**\[Tooltip\]** controls whether GuildCrafts injects crafter info into item tooltips. Disable it when popular items generate tooltips that are too long in large guilds. Persists across sessions.

**\[Minimap\]** shows or hides the minimap icon without needing a slash command. Glows gold when visible.

### Online Status Indicator

Every member row shows a coloured status dot:

*   **Green** — online, GuildCrafts active
*   **Yellow** — online, addon not detected (may have uninstalled)
*   **Grey** — offline

# Quality of Life Features

### Favorites — Bookmark Recipes and Crafters

Star recipes or crafters you use often and access them instantly from the Favorites tab.

Perfect for raid consumables, enchant contacts, and crafting partners.

### Cooldown Tracking

GuildCrafts tracks profession cooldowns across your guild:

*   Transmutes (Primal Might, etc.)

Quickly see **which cooldowns are available** without asking in chat.

GuildCrafts tracks profession specializations:

*   Transmutation / Elixir / Potion Master
*   Mooncloth / Shadoweave / Spellfire Tailoring

# Slash Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/gc` | Open the GuildCrafts window |
| `/gc minimap` | Toggle the minimap button |
| `/gc reset` | Clear your local database and re-scan |
| `!gc <query>` | Search for crafters from **guild chat** |

Example: `!gc shadowcloth`

***

# How the Sync Works

GuildCrafts synchronizes recipe data automatically between addon users.

*   No setup required
*   Low chat traffic — only one reachable guild member responds to `!gc` queries
*   New recipes broadcast instantly when learned
*   Instanced addon users stay silent so they cannot create duplicate responses
*   Members who leave the guild are cleaned up after 7 days
*   Inactive members (no data update in 45 days) are auto-pruned
*   If your data is more than 30 days old, a one-time reminder appears on login

Works best when multiple guild members use the addon — the more players sync, the more complete the database.

GuildCrafts normalizes connected-realm names so the same character is not
counted as multiple addon users. Players inside raids, dungeons, battlegrounds,
or arenas do not answer `!gc` because GUILD addon messages cannot reliably cross
those boundaries; this prevents duplicate guild-chat responses. If every addon
user is instanced, the query may wait until someone is back in the open world.

final release is **2.0.2**. The project remains available as-is for anyone who
